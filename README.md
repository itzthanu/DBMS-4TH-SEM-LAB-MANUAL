Create a table called Employee with the following structure. Name Data Type Empno Number Ename Varchar(20) Job Varchar(20) Mgr_no Number Salary Number 
a) Create a table Employee 
b) Add Primary Key constraints and Not Null Constraints to the employee table 
c) Add a column commission with domain to the Employee table. 
d) Insert any five records into the table. 
e) Update the column details of job. 
f) Rename the column of Employee table using alter command. 
g) Delete the employee whose empno is 105.
 h) Find salaries of employee in Ascending Order.
 i) Find grouped salaries of employees.

 
SOLUTION:
A)	CREATE DATABASE EMPLOYEE_DETAILS
USE EMPLOYEE_DETAILS

B)	CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
    EMPNO INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ENAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    JOB VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    MGR_NO INT NOT NULL,
    SALARY DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);


C)	ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
ADD COMMISSION NUMBER; OR
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
ADD COMMISSION DECIMAL(10, 2);


D)	INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(‘101’,’ALICE’,’DESIGNER’,001,50000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(‘102’,’BOB’,’ANALYST’,001,60000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(‘103’,’CLAV’,’HR’,001,90000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(‘104’,’DAN’,’DEVELOPER’,001,70000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(‘105’,’ELON’,’SENIOR DESIGNER’,001,50000);

E)	UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET JOB=”DEVELOPER”
WHERE EMPNO=’104’;

F)	ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
RENAME COLUMN MGR_NO, MANAGER_NO;

G)	DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE EMPNO=’105’;

H)	SELECT SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY SALARY ALL;

I)	SELECT SALARY,COUNT(*)
FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY SALARY;

OR

CREATE DATABASE EMPLOYEE_DETAILS;
USE EMPLOYEE_DETAILS;

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
    EMPNO INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ENAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    JOB VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    MGR_NO INT NOT NULL,
    SALARY DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
ADD COMMISSION DECIMAL(10, 2);

INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, MGR_NO, SALARY) VALUES (101, 'ALICE', 'DESIGNER', 001, 50000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, MGR_NO, SALARY) VALUES (102, 'BOB', 'ANALYST', 001, 60000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, MGR_NO, SALARY) VALUES (103, 'CLAV', 'HR', 001, 90000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, MGR_NO, SALARY) VALUES (104, 'DAN', 'DEVELOPER', 001, 70000);
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, MGR_NO, SALARY) VALUES (105, 'ELON', 'SENIOR DESIGNER', 001, 50000);

UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET JOB = 'DEVELOPER'
WHERE EMPNO = 104;

-- Adjust column renaming based on your DBMS:
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
RENAME COLUMN MGR_NO TO MANAGER_NO;

DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE EMPNO = 105;

SELECT SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY SALARY;

SELECT SALARY, COUNT(*)
FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY SALARY;
